        # says that cars using a 1st generation charger may use up to 30% more power
        # at 6A vs 40A!  However, the data refers to 120V 12A charging vs 240V 40A
        # charging. 120V 12A is technically the same power as 240V 6A, but the car
        # batteries need 400V DC to charge and a lot more power is wasted converting
        # 120V AC to 400V DC than 240V AC to 400V DC.
        #
        # The main point is 6A charging wastes a lot of power, so we default to charging
        # at a minimum of 12A by setting minAmpsPerTWC to 12. I picked 12A instead of 10A
        # because there is a theory that multiples of 3A are most efficient, though I
        # couldn't find any data showing that had been tested.
        #
        # Most EU chargers are connected to 230V, single-phase power which means 12A is
        # about the same power as in US chargers. If you have three-phase power, you can
        # lower minAmpsPerTWC to 6 and still be charging with more power than 12A on
        # single-phase.  For example, 12A * 230V * 1 = 2760W for single-phase power, while
        # 6A * 230V * 3 = 4140W for three-phase power. Consult an electrician if this
        # doesn't make sense.

        # The best charge rate is the capacity of the battery pack / 2.  Home chargers
        # can't reach that rate, so charging as fast as your wiring supports is best
        # from that standpoint.  It's not clear how much damage charging at slower
        # rates really does.
