# TWCManager
TWCManager lets you control the amount of power delivered by a Tesla Wall Connector (TWC) to the car it's charging.

Due to hardware limitations, TWCManager will not work with Tesla's older High Power Wall Connector (HPWC) EVSEs that were discontinued around April 2016.

See **TWCManager Installation.pdf** for how to install and use.
