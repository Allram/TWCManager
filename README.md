# TWCManager
TWCManager lets you control the amount of power delivered by a Tesla Wall Connector (TWC) to the car it's charging.

**TWCs released after around December 2017 can not currently be controlled by TWCManager.**  I have not yet found a way to stop newer TWCs from charging without risking putting the car into an error state where it will not charge again until the TWC is re-plugged.  I will release new code if I can find a solution.  Please see [this thread](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/new-wall-connector-load-sharing-protocol.72830/page-10) for updates.

Due to hardware limitations, TWCManager will not work with Tesla's older High Power Wall Connector (HPWC) EVSEs that were discontinued around April 2016.

See **TWCManager Installation.pdf** for how to install and use.
